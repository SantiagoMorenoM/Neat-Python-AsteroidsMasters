Project developed to create agents able to play the game Atari Asteroids, using the NEAT-Python library. 
Original Asteroids game that was modified to implement NEAT can be found here: https://github.com/TheBeachLab/asteroids  
And the example that was used as inspiration for the NEAT implementation can be found here: https://github.com/finnformica/Asteroids-with-NEAT-python
